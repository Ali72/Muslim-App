# Muslim-App (10DaysAppChallenge 2020)

With the approch of **Ramadan 2020** and after gaining some knowledge on Android development with java and working on small projects during **COVID19 Quarantine**, I decided to make a Muslim Android App that contains Prayer times, Rememberance, Qibla Finder, Zakat Calculator and other features ...

# Screenshots
Here is some screenshots from inside, so if you understand arabic go check the download link or apk folder, I'm planning to release an English version of the app very soon


# 10Days Journey
* **14 April** : Looking for icons, backgrounds, assets. Thinking about a simple UI design.

* **22 April** :

I hope i'll finish the challenge on time *(20 April)*


## What i've learned
I've learned and still learning too many things while coding this app as i'm planning to release it to PlayStore and update it each time with some new features and improve UX and UI.
I've learned also the Learning On Demand skill because when I raised the challenge, I knew that it will be difficult, I will face bugs and errors multiple times and I'll need to work with new technologies that i've never used before and i need to finish the App on 10 days, but these difficulties were also a part from the challenge.

## What's next:
Actually I want to work with other Mobile development platforms like Flutter, Kotlin, React Native. Also I'm interested on the web developement and I want to start it asap.
